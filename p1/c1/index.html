            <h2>Idea 1</h2>
            <h3>Particle Physics Beyond the Higgs Boson</h3>
            <p>An exploration of the current frontiers in particle physics following the 2012 Higgs discovery. This could examine the search for dark matter particles, investigations into the matter-antimatter asymmetry, precision studies of Higgs properties, and future collider experiments. The project would also cover theoretical frameworks like supersymmetry and extra dimensions that physicists are testing to explain phenomena beyond the Standard Model.</p>

        <div class="idea-section">
            <h2>Idea 2</h2>
            <h3>Art and Design as Resistance in Contemporary Political Climate</h3>
            <p>An analysis of how contemporary artists and designers respond to rising authoritarianism and economic inequality. This could explore community-based art practices, design for social justice, the role of public art in building solidarity, and how creative communities develop alternative economic models. The study would examine case studies of activist design, counter-propaganda strategies, and the preservation of democratic values through creative expression.</p>

        <div class="idea-section">
            <h2>Idea 3</h2>
            <h3>Wabi-Sabi Philosophy and the Art of Kintsugi</h3>
            <p>A comprehensive study of wabi-sabi as a Japanese aesthetic philosophy that finds beauty in imperfection and transience. This could trace its origins in Buddhist philosophy and tea ceremony culture, explore its influence on contemporary design and mindfulness practices, and examine kintsugi as both artistic technique and philosophical metaphor for resilience, healing, and the beauty of visible repair.</p>
