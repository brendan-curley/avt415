            <h2>Idea 1</h2>
            <h3>Particle Physics Beyond the Higgs Boson</h3>
            <p>The Higgs discovery in 2012 completed the Standard Model, but major mysteries remain. Current frontiers include understanding dark matter and dark energy (which comprise 95% of the universe), exploring physics beyond the Standard Model through precision measurements of Higgs properties, and investigating why matter dominates over antimatter. Future projects like the proposed Future Circular Collider aim to probe higher energy scales, while underground detectors search for dark matter particles and neutrino experiments explore these ghostly particles' properties.</p>

            <h2>Idea 2</h2>
            <h3>Art and Design Navigating Fascism in Late-Stage Capitalism</h3>
            <p>Artists and designers are responding to authoritarianism through various strategies: creating accessible public art that builds community solidarity, using design to counter misinformation and promote media literacy, developing mutual aid networks and alternative economic models, and preserving cultural memory through documentation projects. Many focus on amplifying marginalized voices, creating spaces for democratic dialogue, and using aesthetic resistance to challenge oppressive narratives while building resilience in creative communities.</p>

            <h2>Idea 3</h2>
            <h3>Wabi-Sabi: Philosophy and Practice</h3>
            <p>
Wabi-sabi is a Japanese aesthetic philosophy celebrating imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness. Originating from Buddhist teachings and tea ceremony traditions, it finds beauty in weathered materials, asymmetry, and the passage of time. Kintsugi (golden repair) exemplifies this philosophy by mending broken pottery with gold lacquer, making the repair visible rather than hiddenâ€”transforming breakage into beauty and honoring the object's history. This practice reflects core wabi-sabi principles: embracing flaws as part of an object's unique story rather than trying to restore original perfection.</p>
